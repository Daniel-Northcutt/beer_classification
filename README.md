## Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to be able to identify a database of beer information by their attributes to see if I can accurately classify under the BA Beer Style Classification guideline.

## Project Description
As someone who worked in the beer & wine industry for nearly 10 years I thought it would be fun to run a machine learning model to see if I can classify the beer style by the details given by a particular beer's attributes.  SRM, ABV, and IBU are my driving factors along with keywords in the description to help identify the beers.  The data comes from JSON files of 30,140 different beers.
